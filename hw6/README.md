Assignment:

CSc 21200 – 2018 Fall
Homework 6
Due December 5th, 2018 (No late homework will be accepted)
You will need to submit a written report with part of your codes and your source code via Blackboard. You also need to bring in a hard copy of the report with part of your codes to the class on the day that this is due.
Name your header file as LastName(3 to 5 letters)_FirstNameInitial_HW6_QX.h and your implementation file as LastName(3 to 5 letters)_FirstNameInitial_HW6_QX.cpp
Note: You can only use iostream, cassert, cctype, cmath, cstdio, and cstdlib.
1. Create a temple class called graph as an adjacency matrix with the following:
a. Private member variables for label/name for the vertices, weighted edges, and number of
vertices
b. Constructors (default and copy)
c. Add a vertex
d. Add an edge
e. Remove an edge
f. Print the edges as a matrix (neatly)
g. Return the size
h. Return number of edges
i. Return is there an edge between two vertices
j. Return the neighbors of a vertices
2. Same as question one but implemented as an adjacency list.
a. Instead of printing the edges as a matrix, print it as a list
3. Write the following as a template function:
a. Depth first
b. Breadth first
4. Write a function for Dijkstra’s algorithm.


Example structures of the report:
1. An overview of this homework
2. Code for question 1
3. Code for question 2
4. ... other questions
5. Any improvements, problems, etc. of the class/functions
Code should be Consolas font size 8 to 10.
