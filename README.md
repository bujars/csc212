# CSC 212 DATA STRUCUTRES


Please note that this work was for class assignments.
I have many comments on the code which just pertain to things that I thought of and jotted down. The comments do not necessarily represent what the function is doing/is about.

For cleaner code/explanations you can view the pdf submissions.




Some code may or may not work, but purposes was merely to understand the concept.

Some things, such as graphs, were over complicated and can be simplified. 

Feel free to use my work as a took to understanding different data structures.
